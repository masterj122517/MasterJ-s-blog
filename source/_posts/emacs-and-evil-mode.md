# All right
I am not a treater if you want to call me that
I still use __neovim__ a lot
But I feel like I am using someshit to write code in emacs
in neovim somehow i just don't feel like i am writing code it's __wired__ so I gave emacs a try
It's turns out pretty good to use 
It's been like here for 45 years still good to use  
shot out to __RMS__ 

I learned someshit from it
